Here's what we have here:\r\n\r\nDependency graph for Objective-C projects.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nHere's a small example of some example project that was written on objective-c  \r\nYou can play around with parameters, zoom, select/deselect nodes, and filter nodes by classnames they represents  \r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\n0. Compiled project  \r\n1. Ruby script that generates Dependency graph with information from object files those were generated on the compilation phase\r\n2. Graph visualiser(HTML+Javasript) that takes JSON after Ruby script as input, and builds visual representation of dependency graph with [d3js](http://d3js.org/) library tool\r\n3. Profit\r\n\r\n\r\n### Wanna try?\r\nHere's \"one line\" script that will do all the work\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer.git ;\r\ncd objc-dependency-visualizer ;\r\n./generate-objc-dependencies-to-json.rb -s \"\" > origin.js ;\r\nopen index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\nAll other information can be found on the [project page](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
